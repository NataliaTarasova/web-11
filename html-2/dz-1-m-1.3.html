        <p>
            <dd>
                <dl><b>Hypertext Markup Language <u class="decoration">(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language
                    for
                    creating web pages and web applications.

                    <p> Web browsers receive <u class="decoration">HTML</u> dosents from a web server or from local
                        storage
                        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u class="decoration">HTML</u> describes the
                        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
                        document.</p>

                    <u class="decoration">HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u class="decoration">HTML</u>
                    pages. With <u class="decoration">HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
                    forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u class="decoration">HTML</u> provides a means to
                    create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
                    lists, links, quotes and other items. <u class="decoration">HTML</u> elements are delineated by
                    <i>tags</i>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="marked color">img/ </span> and
                    <span class="marked color">input/</span> directly introduce
                    content into the page. Other tags such as <u class="marked color"><code><p></code></u> surround and
                    provide
                    information about document text and
                    may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u class="decoration">HTML</u>
                    tags, but use them to
                    interpret the content of the page.

                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="center">Markup</h2>

                    <u class="decoration">HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called
                    <i>tags</i> (and their
                    <i>attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types, character references and entity references</i>.
                    <u class="decoration">HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="marked color">h1
                    </span> and <span class="marked color">/h1 </span>, although some
                    represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span class="marked color">img/ </span>.
                    The
                    first tag in such a pair is the
                    <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>and tag</i>e (they are also called <i>opening tags</i>
                    and <i>closing tags</i>).

                    <p>Another important component is the <u class="decoration">HTML</u> <i>document type
                            declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode
                        rendering.</p>

                    The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
                    <pre class="marked">
                <code>
                    <br>
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>

                <head>
                    <title>This is a title</title>
                </head>

                <body>
                    <p>Hello world!</p>
                </body>

                </html>
            </br>
            </code> 
            </pre>
